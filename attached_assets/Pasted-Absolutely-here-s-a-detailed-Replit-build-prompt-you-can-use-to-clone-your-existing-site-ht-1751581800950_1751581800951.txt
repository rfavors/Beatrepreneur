## 🚀 Key Steps After Building

✅ Point your domain beatrepreneur.com to your Replit project (you can update DNS to Replit’s domain alias IPs).
✅ Add HTTPS via Replit’s domain management.
✅ Remove hosting from Hostinger after verifying the Replit deployment is working perfectly.
✅ Optionally, update your old Hostinger server’s DNS records to redirect all traffic to the new Replit app (301 redirect).
